# REQUIREMENTS

A calendar is used to regulize your schedules. It is used to know holidays. It is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.It can be used in both(Linux and Windows).


# ADVANTAGES

Calendars are a simple and effective tool to help keep us productive and maximize our day.But don’t get caught up on which tool to use, or whether to use a paper calendar or one online. The important part is practicing the habit of using a calendar, and following through with your activities according to the time blocks you assign yourself. Your time and attention are your most valuable resources, don’t let them go to waste.

* PLAN FOR STUDY TIME
* TRACK DUE DATES
* KEEPS FAMILY INFORMED


# DISADVANTAGES

* corruption may be occur

# CONCLUSION

Finally I conclude that using the C programing we can build a calendar. I have learned to make our code more efficient and also works under any kind situation.The concepts of C program which I have used in the code is very understandable and userfriendly, from this project I gained many experience related to industrial structure that how should the project should be started and ended in industrial and civilized manner.
